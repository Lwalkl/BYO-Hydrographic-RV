## Build Your Own Hydrographic Research Vessel
A wiki for building your own hydrographic surveying vessel using a personal watercraft, following the design of the JagSki (created by Dr. Bret Webb, University of South Alabama).

## Tutorials
The tutorials [**in this repo's wiki**](https://github.com/NCSU-CHAZ/BYO-Hydrographic-RV/wiki) provide step-by-step(ish) instructions on how to augment a personal watercraft with a Sontek HydroSurveyor ADCP to be used as a hydrographic research vessel. Open an [issue](https://github.com/NCSU-CHAZ/BYO-Hydrographic-RV/issues) to ask question or provide documentation suggestions!
