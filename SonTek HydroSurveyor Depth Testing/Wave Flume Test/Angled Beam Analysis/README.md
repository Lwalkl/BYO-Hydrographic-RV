## Notes

- Each angled beam (beams 1-4) is offset 25 degrees from the vertical beam. A 25 degree correction is applied to the beam ranges to obtain the vertical depth.
- For each trial, the median beam depth for each of the angled beams is compared to the vertical beam range, and the standard deviation for each angled beam is recorded
